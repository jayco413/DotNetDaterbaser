# SQL Script Directory

Follow these conventions when preparing the folder of scripts consumed by DotNetDaterbaser.

1. Choose a single directory to hold all `.sql` files.
2. Prefix each file with the server and database names, e.g. `MyServer_MyDb_`.
3. After the database is initially created, include a `full_database_script.sql` file named:
   
   ```
   <server>_<database>_full_database_script.sql
   ```
   
   This script is executed once to create the database from scratch.
4. Additional incremental scripts must end with `_script.sql` and include both a timestamp and a short description:
   
   ```
   <server>_<database>_<yyyyMMddHHmmss>_<description>_script.sql
   ```
5. Keep `tracking.json` and this `AGENTS.md` file in the same directory. They are maintained by DotNetDaterbaser.
